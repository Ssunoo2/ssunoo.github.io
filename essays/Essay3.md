## To Less of the Same
I found my mind being honed like a blade over a whetstone for the duration of my academic history. It was always exhilarating to learn a new thing, to fill out a new page of notes and to see the metaphorical lightbulb light up hovering over your head. And just when I got to the peak of my journey and graduated, I jumped off into the real world. 

I quickly learned that the real world (at least in my case) was more of a grind than a constant endeavor to learn and achieve and grow. To the contrary, I felt my mind beginning to dull as the days clumped together and the tasks and procedures once challenging and stimulating began to become routine. “It’s mostly like this all the way to the top”, I was told by many of my superiors and mentors; and so I began to search elsewhere for some way to stave off boredom and routine. 

I already have a degree and was determined to go to graduate school. I decided that a post-baccalaureate in computer science would be my version of grad school and am happy to pursue something that I finally enjoy.  So far, I’ve only learned rudimentary coding, but I am hoping to be able to utilize the litany of applications that will allow me to create meaningful code in a form that others can use. I hope one day that when I try to troubleshoot a problem and click on the first google search result on StackOverflow, that the jargon used becomes demystified. I hope that when I try to alter some existing code for software or machines, that I don’t find myself copy pasting snippets of code  until a solution works, but that I can actually write and understand it myself. But overall, I hope to become proficient enough to make applications and code that can add to the vast ocean of information currently available that even one person finds useful.
