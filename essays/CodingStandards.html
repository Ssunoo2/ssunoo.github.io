  <p>Coding standards are standards that people should abide by if they are going to expect their work to be seen or used by others or to engage meaningfully with any other users and/or developer at any point in time during their career including pre-grad, post grad and hobbyist development so that they can maintain proper cadence and readability so that work can be shared and new insights can be given from differing perspectives.</p>

<p>Wow, try to say that sentence in one breath. Notice how even in the communicated English language, there exist writing standards that are put in place to somewhat universalize writing practices. Did you notice that the thoughts were not well spaced out? By the time you reach the last trailing thought, you probably forgot what the opening paragraph introduced and left you wishing that there was appropriate punctuation to space out the jumble of thoughts and lend proper cadence to the paragraph.</p>

<p>In general, most forms of communication from speaking to strangers on the street to sending a formal work email have a set of rules that are to be followed that facilitate easier communication. Most of these are localized to specific networks or biomes. Notice how people in varying regions across the United states may deliver their words in a different cadence, possess a different vocabulary/slang and present themselves in different ways.</p>

<p>Coding, like many spoken languages, is just another form of communication. And like differing forms of communication, it is natural that there is an established way of things. In development, this takes shape in the form of coding standards. Because developers often interact with one another and may or may not share their code for insight or collaboration, it is important that code is written in a way that is the most legible to the most people.</p>
