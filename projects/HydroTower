Aquaponic planter
Laziness is often attributed to being the father of invention. I had attempted to start a garden of my own, however I noted that it (1) took up too much space and (2) required watering every day. How outrageous! My solution was to implement a vertical hydroponic farm that would be fed on a timer and would only need the water to be refilled once a day.

I started with some STLs I found online at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2403922. This would only require 2 inch net pots and some medium to hold the plants and their roots. Unfortunately, the base for the tower was designed for a pot found only at IKEA, which is a bummer because Swedish furniture stores don’t really exist in Hawaii.

I went to the local hardware store and found 2 gallon buckets that I deemed sufficient volume for a week of watering and loaded up Fusion 360. The adapter fits the original modular towers and fits snugly on top of a 2 gallon bucket. It has holes for electrical cords from pond/aquarium pumps and additional support structures underneath the lid. Direct sunlight and the weight of the towers as they house growing plants led to worries that the lid could break or warp. To combat this, I also designed rings to hold ½ inch PVC pipes that could act similar to legs of a table adn provide additional support
