Fhe game takes place over a simulated year, indicated by each month of the year (January, February, etc.). Fish are filled into an array and players take turns, prompting them to fish from the pond with variable rates of catching a fish (3 attempts each per month). A fish is returned with additional information detailing the fishâ€™s species and size. Players are prompted to either keep the fish or throw the fish back into the pond. Different species of fish have legal sizes and seasons in which they can be kept. A player who decides to keep a fish that is not within the legal size range or is caught out of the fishing season for that particular fish is punished by having their entire bucket of fish emptied. The game ends when the twelve months are over and the number of fish in each bucket are compared. The player with more fish in the bucket is declared the winner.
