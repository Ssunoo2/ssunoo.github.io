## Capstone Project: [Kaiaulu](https://github.com/sailuh/kaiaulu)

**Kaiaulu** is a data automation and analysis platform developed as a capstone project to analyze software development communities and identify Social Smells. This project automated the retrieval of project data from tools like GitHub, JIRA, and Bugzilla using APIs, processed the data in JSON format, and prepared it for comprehensive analysis. The results provided valuable insights into developer activity and trends within open-source communities.

### Key Contributions
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Built CRON jobs to schedule and execute regular API requests, ensuring real-time data updates.  
- **API Integration**: Connected with project management tools (GitHub, JIRA, Bugzilla) to fetch and aggregate data in JSON format.  
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Parsed and transformed JSON data for statistical and visual analysis using R, providing actionable insights.  
- **Collaborative Development**: Worked with a team to define project goals, distribute tasks, and ensure successful implementation of features.

### Technologies Used
- **Languages/Tools**: R, CRON, RESTful APIs, JSON  
- **Platforms**: GitHub, JIRA, Bugzilla
