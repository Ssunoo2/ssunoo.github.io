## Rio Connect

Rio Connect is a web-based application built with **Meteor** and **React** that catalogs the Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The platform simplifies club discovery for students by providing an intuitive interface to browse and join clubs based on their interests. Students can create accounts, access detailed club information such as leadership contacts and descriptions, and manage their memberships.

The development of Rio Connect emphasized full-stack development using **Meteor** for backend functionality and real-time updates, **React** for a dynamic and responsive user interface, and **MongoDB** for database management. The project also incorporated application performance monitoring via **Monti APM** and was deployed using **Digital Ocean**. Agile methodologies, including bi-weekly meetings and delegated tasks, ensured the successful completion of the app.
